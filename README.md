# Detecting Fraudulent Financial Activity Using Behavioral Signals and Machine Learning

> A personal research project on synthetic data generation and fraud detection: built from scratch using Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, and Oracle.

---

## Motivation

During my Data Science Engineering internship at Mastercard, I worked on financial fraud detection and anomaly analysis as part of our team's internal hackathon. That experience sparked my curiosity about how behavioral signals — the way people transact, not just what they transact — can reveal fraudulent activity.

This project is my independent deep dive into that problem. I designed the entire pipeline from scratch: generating realistic synthetic transaction data, engineering behavioral features, training and comparing ML models, and storing everything in an Oracle-compatible schema. No starter code, no templates — just me exploring how data synthesis and machine learning can tackle fraud detection in fintech.

## What I Built

- **Synthetic data generator from scratch** — 50,000 transactions across 2,000 customers with 5 realistic fraud archetypes (card testing, account takeover, bust-out, identity theft, friendly fraud), built using statistical distributions and behavioral modeling
- **17 engineered behavioral features** — transaction velocity, amount z-scores, geographic mismatches, temporal anomalies, session patterns, and a composite risk score
- **3 ML models compared** — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost with class-balanced training for imbalanced data
- **Oracle database layer** — full DDL schema, analytical queries, and bulk-load scripts
- **End-to-end reproducible pipeline** — one command (`make run-all`) runs everything

## Why Synthetic Data?

Real financial transaction data is sensitive and hard to access. Instead of relying on overused public datasets, I researched how to generate realistic synthetic data that preserves the statistical properties and behavioral patterns of real-world fraud. This involved modeling customer spending profiles with lognormal distributions, simulating fraud patterns based on documented attack vectors, engineering features that capture the *behavioral* difference between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, and maintaining a realistic class imbalance (~3.5% fraud rate).

The data generation logic itself is a core contribution of this project — not just a preprocessing step.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection-behavioral-signals.git
cd fraud-detection-behavioral-signals

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate the dataset
python src/data/generate_dataset.py

# Run full pipeline
make run-all
```

## Models & Results

| Model               | ROC-AUC | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.9899  | 0.6164    | 0.9457 | 0.7463   |
| Random Forest       | 0.9949  | 0.9583    | 0.9200 | 0.9388   |
| XGBoost             | 0.9967  | 0.9471    | 0.9200 | 0.9333   |

> **Random Forest** achieved the best F1-Score (0.94), balancing precision and recall. **XGBoost** had the highest ROC-AUC (0.997). Logistic Regression traded precision for recall — catching 94.6% of fraud but with more false positives.

## Key Behavioral Features

| Feature                 | What it captures                                 | Signal |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|
| `behavioral_risk_score` | Composite score from all behavioral signals       | High   |
| `amount_zscore`         | How unusual is this amount for this customer?     | High   |
| `ip_velocity`           | Transaction frequency from same IP                | High   |
| `failed_auth_count`     | Failed login attempts before transaction          | High   |
| `province_mismatch`     | Transaction location ≠ home location              | Medium |
| `is_night`              | Transactions between 10pm–5am                     | Medium |
| `short_session_flag`    | Session under 15 seconds (bot-like behavior)      | Medium |

## Oracle Integration

The `sql/` directory contains everything needed to deploy to Oracle:
- `ddl/create_tables.sql` — Schema with proper data types, indexes, and foreign keys
- `queries/fraud_analysis.sql` — 8 ready-to-run analytical queries
- `scripts/bulk_load.sql` — External table setup for CSV bulk import

## Future Work

- **Graph analysis** — model transaction networks to detect fraud rings
- **Anomaly detection** — Isolation Forest and Autoencoders for unsupervised detection
- **Real-time scoring** — stream processing for online model serving
- **SHAP explanations** — per-transaction feature contribution for analyst review
